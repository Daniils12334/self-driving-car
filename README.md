# Self Driving Car Simulation

This is a simple **self-driving car simulation** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The project was created as part of **self-learning** following a YouTube tutorial by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp).

## 🚗 Features

- Car controlled with **arrow keys**
- Basic physics: acceleration, friction, rotation
- **Sensors** for detecting distance (rays)
- **Road lanes** and basic lane logic
- Modular code structure (each component in separate JS file)

## ⚡ How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Use **arrow keys** to control the car.  
3. Enjoy the simulation!
